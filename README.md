# Hello there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Pato and I love to geek over things, am passionate over most things
remotely close to engineering, and always have way too many sideprojects
ongoing.

I write Rust professionally and for most of my side projects. I occasionally
like to dip my toes into Swift, in particular SwiftUI for that sweet native app
feel.

I specialize in distributed systems: I have done work in consensus algorithms,
distributed networking, and persistent storage systems.

I spend most of my time in [Neovim][neovim] running inside [Wezterm][wezterm],
thanks to help of [rust-analyzer][lsp]. I cannot live without
[Starship][starship], [Ripgrep][rg], and [Delta][delta].

You can find me on <a rel="me" href="https://osbar.space/@p">Mastodon</a>.
